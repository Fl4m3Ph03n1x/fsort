#  fsort

## What is `fsort` ?

`fsort` is a library that implements various sorting algorithms and exposes dia via a fucntional API.

## Why fsort ?

`fsort` main focus in on its functional API which has the following characteristics:

1. Every sorting function is pure. We don't modify nor mutate the input we receive.
2. Our API is curried.
3. We apply a data-last approach to every function.

If you are a functional programmer looking for a sorting library, this was made for you.

Furthermore our implementations are as fast as possible for each algorithm, and we also provide a decent documentation on each implementation that you can explore for further details.

## How to use fsort ?

Run:

```
npm i fsort
```

##  Big-O Complexity Chart

In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms by how they respond to changes in input size, such as how the processing time of an algorithm changes as the problem size becomes extremely large.
