/**
 * @desc
 * ## What?
 *
 * Bubble sort ( aka sinking sort ) is an algorithm that steps through a list comparing adjacent items and swapping then when necessary.
 * This pass through is completed until no more swaps are needed.
 *
 * | Best-case perf. | Worst-case perf.  | Average perf. | Worst-case space perf.  | Stable  |
 * | :-------------- | :---------------  | :------------ | :---------------------  | :-----  |
 * | O(n)            | O(nˆ2)            | O(nˆ2)        | O(1) aux                | Yes     |
 *
 * ## When?
 * When considering this algorithm, it is widely suggested to invest in other quadratic algorithms which generally produces faster results.
 *
 * This algorithm main strength is not used to sort but to detect elements out of order.
 * This happens because it is able to detect if an array is not ordered very rapidly and it can be executed in various sections of the array in parallel.

 *
 * ## Variations:
 * - Odd-even sort and cocktail sort are both parallel versions of this algorithm.
 * - In some cases, the the algorithm starts from right to left. This is usual with partially sorted arrays, or arrays with unsorted items added to the end.
